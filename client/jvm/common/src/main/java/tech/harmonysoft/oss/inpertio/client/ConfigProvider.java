 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     It's possible that particular settings are used in external setup, e.g. we might define server socket's port
 *     in configs, then an application opens a listening socket on that port on startup and even if the port value
 *     is changed later, the socket is already open. In this situation the application can
 *     {@link ConfigEventManager#subscribe(ConfigChangedEventAware) subscribe} to {@link ConfigChangedEvent},
 *     when an event for the target config class is received, close previous socket and open new one on the new port.
 * </p>
